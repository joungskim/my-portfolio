During quarterly releases, tests would catch errors where, in some cases, requirements were not being met through automated testing.  Specifically, a component overhaul in Patient Signatures where actions dispatched to Redux were not managing the state of a lookup list button properly.  It would instead open the previous modal dialog.  A snapshot of the html code provided insight on the error the overhaul created during workflow functional testing.',
