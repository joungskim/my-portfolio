Implemented Dev Blog portion of the web application as a starting point to compile notes on completed tasks to present to client side/employers.  Implemented the intial design of how the page will look.  Will not implement Redux for this page as I believe lifecycle hooks will be more than fitting for what this web app will offer.  Implemented navLinkClick callback to change state managed in App.js.'
